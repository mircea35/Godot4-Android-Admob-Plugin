# GodotAdMob

This is an Android AdMob plugin for Godot Engine (https://github.com/okamstudio/godot) 4.x. It is based on the plugin made by Shin-NiL (https://github.com/Shin-NiL/Godot-Android-Admob-Plugin) for Godot 3.2.2.

Currently, this plugin supports:
- Banner
- Interstitial
- Rewarded Video
- [Rewarded Interstitial](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/rewarded-interstitial)

## Setup

### Video Guide
Our friend *dQuigz* created a [nice video tutorial on how to use this plugin](https://youtu.be/0a6EvlNgLL0).

### Text Instructions
- Configure, install  and enable the "Android Custom Template" for your project, just follow the [official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/workflow/export/android_custom_build.html);
- go to the [release tab](https://github.com/Shin-NiL/Godot-Android-AdMob-Plugin/releases), choose a version and download the respective ```GodotAdMobPlugin-x.x.x.zip``` package;
- extract the content of the ```admob-plugin``` directory (```GodotAdmob.gdap``` and ```GodotAdmob.release.aar``` from the zip package) inside the ```res://android/plugins``` directory on your Godot project.
- extract the ```admob-lib``` directory (from the zip package) inside the ```res://``` directory on your Godot project.
- on the Project -> Export... -> Android -> Options ->
    - Permissions: check the permissions for _Access Network State_ and _Internet_
    - Custom Template: check the _Use Custom Build_
    - Plugins: check the _Godot Ad Mob_ (this plugin)
- edit the file ```res://android/build/AndroidManifest.xml``` to add your App ID as described [here](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/quick-start#update_your_androidmanifestxml). For the demo project, for example, you should use:
```
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.google.android.gms.ads.APPLICATION_ID"
            android:value="ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713"/>
```
One good place to add this metadata is just below these lines, inside of the **application** tag:
```
<application>
...
<!-- Custom application XML added by add-ons. -->
<!--CHUNK_APPLICATION_BEGIN-->
<!--CHUNK_APPLICATION_END-->

Here
</application>
```
- To avoid the mergeDex error, enable the multidex support. Edit the file ```res://android/build/build.gradle``` and insert the line `multiDexEnabled = true` inside the `android` => `defaultConfig`:
```
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled = true
        ...
    }
}
```


**NOTE**: everytime you install a new version of the Android Build Template this step must be done again, as the ```AndroidManifest.xml``` file will be overriden.


Now you'll be able to add an AdMob Node to your scene (**only one node should be added per scene**)

And connect its signals

## Sample Code

In the demo directory you'll find a working sample project where you can see how the things works on the scripting side.

__REMEMBER__: You still need to configure the project as described in the "Setup" section to be able to run the demo project.

## Showcase

Does this plugin really work? Yes sir! You can see a list of published games [here](showcase.md).

## Compiling the Plugin (optional)

If you want to compile the plugin by yourself, it's very easy:
1. Clone this repository;
2. Checkout the desired version;
3. Download the AAR library for Android plugin from the official Godot website;
4. Copy the downloaded AAR file into the `admob-plugin/godot-lib.release/` directory and rename it to `godot-lib.release.aar`;
5. Configure the demo project according to the "Setup" instructions. Install the "Android Custom Template" for the demo project. This generates the required build configuration.
6. Using command line go to the `admob-plugin/` directory;
7. Run `gradlew build`.

If everything goes fine, you'll find the `.aar` files at `admob-plugin/godotadmob/build/outputs/aar/`.

## Troubleshooting

* First of all, please make sure you're able to compile the custom build for Android without the AdMob plugin, this way we can isolate the cause of the issue.

* Using logcat for Android is the best way to troubleshoot most issues. You can filter Godot only messages with logcat using the command:
```
adb logcat -s godot
```
* _AdMob Java Singleton not found_:
    1. this plugin is Android only, so the AdMob Java singleton will only exists on the Android platform. In other words, you will be able to run it on an Android device (or emulator) only, it will not work on editor or on another platform;
    2. make sure you checked the _Use Custom Build_ and _Godot Ad Mob_ options in the export window.

* App is crashing at startup: use the `logcat` to check what's happening. It can be caused for many different reasons, if you forgot to or not configure correctly you App ID on the `AndroidManifest.xml`, for example, your app will crash.

* Error code 3 (_ERROR_CODE_NO_FILL_) is a common issue with Admob, but out of the scope to this plugin. Here's the description on the API page: [ERROR_CODE_NO_FILL: The ad request was successful, but no ad was returned due to lack of ad inventory.](https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/ads/AdRequest.html#ERROR_CODE_NO_FILL)

* Any other error code: you can find more information about the error codes [here](https://support.google.com/admob/thread/3494603). Please don't open issues on this repository asking for help about that, as we can't provide any, sorry.

* Banner sizes: [Adaptive Banners](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner/adaptive) and [Smart Banners](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner/smart) uses dynamic banner sizes, the [other options](https://developers.google.com/admob/android/banner) uses fixed sizes, please check its respectives documentation for more details. Smart banners are deprecated and may not work properly.
